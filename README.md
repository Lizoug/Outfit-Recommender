# *Outfit Recommendation System*
## Introduction
This project aims to develop an outfit recommendation system using deep learning techniques. The system will take an image from the user as input and suggest a suitable outfit for them. The model will learn to recognize patterns and features in the images, allowing it to make accurate recommendations. 

## Data
The model will be trained on a dataset of images.

The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle:<br> 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset

Or the smaller dataset:<br>

## Model
The model will be implemented using deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNNs will be used to extract features from the images and the final layers will be trained for the task of outfit recommendation.

## Usage
The system can be used by using this system, users will be able to upload a photo of a clothing and receive outfit suggestions.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch
OpenCV
Numpy
Matplotlib
