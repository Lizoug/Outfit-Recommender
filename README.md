# *Outfit Recommendation System*
## Introduction
This project aims to develop an outfit recommendation system using deep learning techniques. The system will take an image of a person as input and suggest a suitable outfit for them.

## Data
The model will be trained on a dataset of images.

The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset

Or the smaller dataset:

## Model
The model will be implemented using deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning. The CNNs will be used to extract features from the images and the final layers will be trained for the task of outfit recommendation.

## Usage
The system can be used by uploading an image of yourself, and the system will recommend a outfit for you

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch
OpenCV
Numpy
Matplotlib
