# *Outfit-Recommender*


*In this project, we aim to develop an outfit recommendation system using deep learning techniques. The system will take an image from a user as input and suggest a suitable outfit for them. To train the model, we will be using a dataset of images of individuals wearing different outfits. The model will learn to recognize patterns and features in the images, allowing it to make accurate recommendations. By using this system, users will be able to upload a photo of themselves and receive personalized outfit suggestions


The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle:
